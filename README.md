# Ex_data_analysis
My course project of Exploratory data nalysis

In this project I have to answer on the next questions: 
1.  Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
2.  Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == “24510”) from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
3.  Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
4.  Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?
5.  How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City?
6.  Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == “06037”). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

The following questions and tasks in exploratory analysis is addressed. For each question / task a single plot is made.
1.The total emissions have decreased in the US from 1999 to 2008 according to plot 1
2.Overall total emissions have decreased in Baltimore City, Maryland since 1999 to 2008.(according to plot 2)
3.The point  increased from 1999-2008. 
4. Emissions from coal combustion related sources have decreased in 1999-2008.
5. Emissions in Baltimore City from motor vehicle sources have dropped in1999-2008
6.The greatest changes over time in motor vehicle emissions being pointed out in Los Angeles County.
